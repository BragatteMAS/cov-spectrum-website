# Adding countries

1. Download relevant map from https://react-vector-maps.netlify.app/maps
   These are json files generated from SVG.
2. Add the .json file to this `/maps` folder.
3. Rename the divisions in the json file to correspond to the fetched data division names

Warning: This does not work when the country divisions are cities, since the available maps are divided by provinces.
